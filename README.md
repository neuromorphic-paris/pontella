# Pontella

Pontella is a lightweight command line parser.

# Installation

## Dependencies

Pontella relies on [Premake 4.x](https://github.com/premake/premake-4.x) (x â‰¥ 3), which is a utility to ease the install process. Follow these steps:
  - __Debian / Ubuntu__: Open a terminal and execute the command `sudo apt-get install premake4`.
  - __Fedora__: Open a terminal and execute the command `sudo dnf install premake`. Then, run<br />
  `echo '/usr/local/lib' | sudo tee /etc/ld.so.conf.d/neuromorphic-paris.conf > /dev/null`.
  - __OS X__: Open a terminal and execute the command `brew install premake`. If the command is not found, you need to install Homebrew first with the command<br />
  `ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"`.

## Install
